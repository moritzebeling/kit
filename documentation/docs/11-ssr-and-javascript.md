title: SSR and JavaScript
---

By default, SvelteKit will render any component first on the server and send it to the client as HTML. It will then render the component again in the browser to make it interactive in a process called **hydration**. For this reason, you need to ensure that components can run in both places. SvelteKit will then initialise a [**router**](#routing) that takes over subsequent navigations.

You can control each of these on a per-app or per-page basis. Note that each of the per-page settings use [`context="module"`](https://svelte.dev/docs#script_context_module), and only apply to page components, _not_ [layout](#layouts) components.

If both are specified, per-page settings override per-app settings in case of conflicts. Each setting can be controlled independently, but `ssr` and `hydrate` cannot both be `false` since that would result in nothing being rendered at all.

### ssr

Disabling [server-side rendering](#introduction-ssr) effectively turns your SvelteKit app into a [**single-page app** or SPA](#introduction-csr-and-spa).

> In most situations this is not recommended: see [the discussion in the intro](#introduction-ssr). Consider whether it's truly appropriate to disable and don't simply disable SSR because you've hit an issue with it.

You can disable SSR app-wide with the [`ssr` config option](#configuration-ssr), or a page-level `ssr` export:

```html
<script context="module">
	export const ssr = false;
</script>
```

### router

In certain circumstances you might need to disable [client-side routing](#introduction-routing) with the app-wide [`router` config option](#configuration-router) or the page-level `router` export:

```html
<script context="module">
	export const router = false;
</script>
```

Note that this will disable client-side routing for any navigation from this page, regardless of whether the router is already active.

### hydrate

Ordinarily, SvelteKit [hydrates](#introduction-hydration) your server-rendered HTML into an interactive page. Some pages don't require JavaScript at all — many blog posts and 'about' pages fall into this category. In these cases you can skip hydration when the app boots up with the app-wide [`hydrate` config option](#configuration-hydrate) or the page-level `hydrate` export:

```html
<script context="module">
	export const hydrate = false;
</script>
```

> If `hydrate` and `router` are both `false`, SvelteKit will not add any JavaScript to the page at all.

### prerender

It's likely that at least some pages of your app can be represented as a simple HTML file generated at build time. These pages can be [_prerendered_](#introduction-prerendering) by your [adapter](#adapters).

If your entire app is suitable for prerendering, you could use [`adapter-static`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static), which will generate HTML files for every page, plus additional files that are requested by `load` functions in those pages.

In many cases, you'll only want to prerender specific pages in your app. You'll need to annotate these pages:

```html
<script context="module">
	export const prerender = true;
</script>
```

The prerenderer will start at the root of your app and generate HTML for any prerenderable pages it finds. Each page is scanned for `<a>` elements that point to other pages that are candidates for prerendering — because of this, you generally don't need to specify which pages should be accessed. If you _do_ need to specify which pages should be accessed by the prerenderer, you can do so with the `pages` option in the [prerender configuration](#configuration-prerender).

> Not all pages are suitable for prerendering. Any content that is prerendered will be seen by all users and will not be personalized. For a more in-depth discussion, see [the prerendering section of the introduction](#introduction-prerendering).

#### Route conflicts

Because prerendering writes to the filesystem, it isn't possible to have two endpoints that would cause a directory and a file to have the same name. For example, `src/routes/foo/index.js` and `src/routes/foo/bar.js` would try to create `foo` and `foo/bar`, which is impossible.

For that reason among others, it's recommended that you always include a file extension — `src/routes/foo/index.json.js` and `src/routes/foo/bar.json.js` would result in `foo.json` and `foo/bar.json` files living harmoniously side-by-side.

For _pages_, we skirt around this problem by writing `foo/index.html` instead of `foo`.
